# Issue tracker for all Vaadin starters

This is an aggregate repository to report any issue found in the starter projects downloaded from https://vaadin.com/start.

As [Business App Starter](https://vaadin.com/docs/business-app/overview.html) and [Bakery](https://vaadin.com/docs/bakeryflow/overview.html) starters don't have public repositories, this is a correct place to fill in a bug report.

Some other starters have their own public Github repo available. If you wish, you can report an issue their optionally.
